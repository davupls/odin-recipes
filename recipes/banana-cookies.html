  <p><em>Chewy Banana Cookies</em></p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups roughly chopped bananas, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium-low heat. Add in chopped walnuts and 1 cup bananas. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until bananas disintegrate, and little browned bits of butter begin to form and stick to the bottom of the pan, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour mixture into a large bowl and allow to cool for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg into butter mixture. Stir in brown sugar and white sugar until thoroughly combined. Mix in egg yolk and vanilla. Add in flour, remaining 3/4 cup sliced bananas, cornstarch, and baking soda and stir until incorporated. Cover dough and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.</li>
    <li>Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized balls of dough; space balls about 1 1/2-inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. </li>
    <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are browned, 12 to 17 minutes (try not to under bake, or the cookies will be too soft). Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
  </ol>
